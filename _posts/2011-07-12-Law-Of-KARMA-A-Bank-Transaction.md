What is “Karma”? There are infinite answers to this question by infinite philosophies but what the Karma actually is? Karma is the ultimate law of nature whose mechanism is very much similar to that of bank transaction.

When we are born an account on our name is automatically opened in the ‘bank of karma’. At that time we have nil balance i.e. our destiny is not defined. As we grow older our deeds and actions pay to our account and makes our destiny. Our good deeds are debited, and as a bank account when we deposit something we get interest along with the deposited amount, we get more than what we give by doing good deeds. The converse is true as well, we have  to pay more than what we take by doing bad deeds same as in bank’s mechanism we have to pay abundant interest to the bank for the loan we take, hence bad deeds are credited as well.

The mechanism mentioned above truly describes the Law of Karma if the concept of rebirth is not taken into account. The question which is of prime importance when the concept of rebirth is considered is that *why some are born more blessed than others?* One is born in a palace and other in a slum. This may be answered by considering the actions of last birth, which are also counted while landing on earth i.e. the sum total of debit and credit of the account of last birth. It means we may not get the fresh account every birth, one single account is issued to the soul, no matter the number of births one may take his account is always active!

The Theories on Karma and rebirth are mere postulates, nothing can said with due sureity. It’s our experiences which tells about the validity of a particular theory.
