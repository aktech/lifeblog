I am a Final year Mathematics and Computing Engineering Student at Delhi Technological University (formerly known as Delhi College of Engineering). I expect to graduate with a Bachelor of Technology degree in 2016.

This is my *non-technical blog*, where I write various articles on life, Karma, etc that may or may not interest you. If you are looking for my technical blog then go here: [http://iamit.in/blog](http://iamit.in/blog)
